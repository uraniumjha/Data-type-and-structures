This property is valuable for scenarios where maintaining consistent unaltered data is essential.\n","\n","8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python ?\n"," - A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index (or hash code) for each key mapping it to a specific bucket or slot in memory. This allows for efficient operations like insertion deletion and lookup with an average time complexity of O(1)\n","\n","9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","  - Yes list contain different data types eg str,float,bool,int\n","\n","10.Why strings are immutable in python\n","  - Strings are immutable in Python to ensure thread safety, memory efficiency, and reliable behavior when used as hashable keys in data structures like dictionaries and sets\n","\n","11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n","  - Dictionaries offer faster lookups and efficient key-value pairing making them ideal for tasks that require quick access by keys or mapping relationships. Unlike lists, dictionaries provide O(1) average time complexity for lookups whereas lists require O(n) for searching elements\n","\n","12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","   - A tuple would be preferable over a list in a scenario where you need to store a fixed collection of related values such as the coordinates of a location (latitude, longitude) and you want to ensure the data remains unchanged. Since tuples are immutable, they guarantee data integrity and can also be used as keys in dictionaries unlike lists.\n","\n","13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","   - Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values\n","\n","14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","   - In list \"in\" check presence of value\n","     In Dict \"in\" check the presence of key\n","\n","15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","   - Tuple is immutable so modification is not alowed\n","\n","16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ?\n","   - A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries allowing hierarchical data representation\n","   students = {\n","    \"Anand\": {\"age\": 20, \"grades\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85}},\n","    \"Ajay\": {\"age\": 22, \"grades\": {\"math\": 88, \"science\": 92}}\n","}\n","\n","17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary ?\n","   - The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary in Python is O(1) on average. This means that retrieving a value using a key takes constant time, regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n","\n","18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n","   - Lists are preferred over dictionaries when you need ordered data allow duplicates or require sequential access by index.\n","\n","19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data\n","   retrieval ?\n","   - Dictionaries are considered unordered because their elements are stored based on hash values, not insertion order, which means the order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed\n","\n","20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data\n","   retrieval?\n","   - In list data is retrive through indexing\n","     In dict data is retrieve
